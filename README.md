# Smart-Door-Lock-System
A smart door lock system using ESP32-CAM and Raspberry Pi enables secure, contactless access by detecting faces. The ESP32 captures images and sends data to the Raspberry Pi, which controls a servo/relay to unlock the door when an authorized face is detected. Ideal for home and office security.
